# Console coffee machine with Python (Pytest) for practicing TDD

This project involves developing a console application that simulates a coffee machine. The main goal is to practice Test-Driven Development (TDD) using Python.

## Coffee preparation:

1. The application prepares the selected coffee.
2. Checks for necessary ingredients (coffee, cups, sugar).
3. Notifies the user if ingredients are missing.
